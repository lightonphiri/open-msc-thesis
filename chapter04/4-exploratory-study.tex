\chapter{Design principles\label{ch:exploratory-study}}

This chapter details the systematic process that was followed in order to
derive the guiding principles that can potentially simplify the design of
\gls{dl} services, effectively making then easier to work with.

The chapter is organised as follows: Section~\ref{sec:exploratory-study:research-perspective} outlines the rationale behind
conducting this exploratory study;
Section~\ref{sec:exploratory-study:research-perspective:research-questions}
introduces and describes the research method that was employed during this phase
of the research; Section~\ref{sec:exploratory-study:methodology} details the
process that was followed to collect and analyse the data; and finally, Section~\ref{sec:exploratory-study:summary} concludes the chapter.

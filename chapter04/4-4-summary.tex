\section{Summary}
\label{sec:exploratory-study:summary}

This chapter discussed the derivation process of a set of design principles
applicable for the design of simple \gls{dl} services which can easily
be operated in resource constrained environments. The development of
applications for resource constrained environments requires careful
consideration and eliciting these requirements during the early stages of the
design process may ensure that the resulting services become tailored for such
domains.

In summary, all the design principles were derived with simplicity and
minimalism and the key criterion.

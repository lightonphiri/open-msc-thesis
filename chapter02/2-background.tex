\chapter{Background\label{ch:background}}

Research in the field of \glspl{dl}\index{Digital Libraries} has been going on for over two decades. The mid 1990s, in particular, saw the emergence of a number of government funded projects \citep{Griffin1998},   conferences \citep{Adam1995}, technical committees \citep{DCMI1999,Lorist2001}⁠ and workshops \citep{Dempsey1996,Lagoze1996}⁠, specifically set up to foster formal research in the field of \glspl{dl}. The rapid technological advances and, more specifically, Web technologies have resulted in a number of different \gls{dls} frameworks, conceptual models, architectural designs and \gls{dl}\index{Digital Libraries} software tools. The variation in the designs can largely be attributed to the different design goals and corresponding specific problems that the solutions were aimed to address.

This chapter is organised as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background:digital-libraries} presents an overview of \glspl{dl}, including definitions and sample application domains; Section~\ref{sec:background:fundamental-concepts} introduces fundamental key concepts behind \glspl{dl}; Section~\ref{sec:background:reference-models-frameworks} is a discussion of pioneering work on some proposed frameworks and reference models that have been applied to the implementation of \gls{dls}; Section~\ref{sec:background:digital-libraries-software} presents related work through a discussion of some popular \gls{floss} tools used for managing digital collections; Section~\ref{sec:background:simple-architectures} broadly discusses designs whose successes are hinged on simplicity; Section~\ref{sec:background:data-storage-architectures} discusses some commonly used storage solutions; and finally Section~\ref{sec:background:software-design-decisions} presents two prominent methods used to capture software design decisions.
%Section~\ref{sec:background:software-design-decisions} more generally discusses how contemporary software decision decisions are elicited.

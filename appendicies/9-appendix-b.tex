The University of Cape Town has assigned ethics clearance authority to Faculty-level Research Ethics Committees. In addition, permission to access staff and student target populations, as research participants, is assigned to the Executive Director: Human Resource and the Executive Director: Student Affairs respectively. In a nutshell, the ethics clearance standard operating procedure ensures that;

\begin{itemize}
 \item Permission to access staff or student populations must be obtained from ED: HR for staff and ED: Student Affairs for students.
 \item This process is separate from the ethics clearance process.
 \item Ethics clearance must be sought from the Faculty-level Research Ethics Committee in the Faculty closest to the area of research proposed.
 \item The proposed research may proceed only when both permission to access and ethics clearance have been obtained.
\end{itemize}

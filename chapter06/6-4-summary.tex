This chapter presented two real-world case study collections based on the simple prototype repository design outlined in Chapter~\ref{ch:implementation}. Furthermore, some \gls{dls} implementations that used each of the case study collections as repository sub-layers were highlighted.

In essence, the case studies serve as proof of concept implementations for real-world practical application of the simple design. In Chapter~\ref{ch:evaluation}, Section~\ref{sec:evaluation:developer-survey}, a user study, in the form of a developer-oriented survey that used the Bleek and Lloyd collection as the primary storage layer, is described.

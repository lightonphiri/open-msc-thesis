\section{Summary}
\label{sec:evaluation-summary}

The results from the developer survey (see Section~\ref{sec:evaluation:developer-survey}) have shown that the resulting simple file-based repository design is easy to work with and could potentially simplify repository management tasks. Furthermore, the results also indicate that a simple file-based repository design would have little impact on the extensibility of an application built on top of such a repository design.

The implementation case study collections outlined in Section~\ref{ch:case-studies} serve as proof that the proposed approach is effective; the Bleek and Lloyd\index{Bleek and Lloyd} case study (see Section~\ref{sec:case-studies:bleek-and-lloyd}) in particular serves as proof that system functionalities and features of existing services based on conventional storage solutions can be replicated using a simple file-based digital object store with little adverse effect.

The scalability performance experiments yielded results that strongly indicate that the performance would be within generally acceptable limits for medium-sized collections, as evidenced in the Kiviat\index{Kiviat} plot shown in Figure~\ref{fig:experimentation:performance:summary:kiviat}. Figure~\ref{fig:experimentation:performance:summary:kiviat} also indicates that ingestion\index{Ingestion} performance is significantly better than the other services. In addition, the performance degradation for all other services occurs for collections with larger than \num{12800} objects. It was further shown that performance degradation of operations such as information discovery and OAI-PMH\index{OAI-PMH} associated services are largely as a result of parsing, a problem that can easily be remedied through the use of an index. 

Finally, it was shown that the superior performance results from the comparative experiments done with DSpace\index{DSpace} are attributed to the external index\index{Index} service---Apache Solr\index{Apache!Solr} and Lucene\index{Lucene}---integrated with DSpace\index{DSpace} to facilitate fast search. However, it was shown in the indexing experiments (see Section~\ref{sec:evaluation:performance:indexing}) that integration of such an external search service could easily be performed using the proposed approach.

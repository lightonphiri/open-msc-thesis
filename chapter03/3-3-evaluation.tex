\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:pilot-study:evaluation}

The main objective of the evaluation was to assess the impact of having
fragmented metadata files for each digital object, and in particular prove that
such a design approach would not negatively impact the static generation of the
collection.

The pilot system was thus evaluated by assessing its effectiveness, and the
digital Bleek and Lloyd collection \citep{Suleman2007} was used as
the case collection. The collection had previously been implemented by
generating static HTML files by parsing a single standalone XML file
containing metadata associated with the digital content \citep{Suleman2007}. An
overview of the Bleek and Lloyd collection is shown in Table
~\ref{tab:pilot-study:overview:collection-profile}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:pilot-study:summary}

The feasibility of conducting the proposed research was determined after
conducting the pilot study. In particular, the successful generation of the
Bleek and Lloyd collection provided the much needed evidence.

In addition, the pilot study helped uncover shortcomings in the general
approach used, effectively setting the course for the proposed research. Some
challenges that were identified include possible problems that would result
when handling large and complex collections, and the viability of statically
generating HTML files for collections with regularly changing content.

\chapter{Designing for simplicity\label{ch:implementation}}

In Chapter~\ref{ch:exploratory-study}, a set of design principles, and the systematic approach used to derived them was outlined. The derived design principles can be applied during the design of the different components of a \gls{dls}---user interface, repository and service layer.

In this chapter, a prototype generic simple repository design, based on the derived design principles, is outlined.

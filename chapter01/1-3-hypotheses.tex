This research was guided by three working hypotheses that are a direct result of grounding work previously conducted \citep{Suleman2007,Suleman2010a}. The three hypotheses are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A formal simplistic abstract framework for \gls{dls} design can be derived.
 \item A \gls{dls} architectural design based on a simple and minimalistic approach could be potentially easy to adopt and manage over time.
 \item The system performance of tools and services based on simple architectures could be adversely affected.
\end{itemize}

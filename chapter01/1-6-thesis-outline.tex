This manuscript is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Chapter~\ref{ch:intro} serves as an introduction, outlining the motivation, research questions and scope of the research conducted.
 \item Chapter~\ref{ch:background} provides background information and related work relevant to the research conducted.
 \item In Chapter~\ref{ch:exploratory-study} the exploratory study that was systematically conducted to derive a set of design principles is described, including the details of the principles derived.
 \item Chapter~\ref{ch:implementation} presents a prototype repository whose design decisions are directly mapped to some design principles outlined in Chapter~\ref{ch:exploratory-study}.
 \item Chapter~\ref{ch:case-studies} describes two real-world case study implementation designed and implemented using the repository design outlined in Chapter~\ref{ch:implementation}.
 \item The implications of the prototype repository design are outlined in Chapter~\ref{ch:evaluation} through: experimental results from a developer-oriented survey conducted to evaluate the simplicity and extensibility; and through scalability performance benchmark results of some \gls{dls} operations conducted on datasets of different sizes.
 \item Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} highlights concluding remarks and recommendations for potential future work.
\end{itemize}

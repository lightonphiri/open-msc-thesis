The last few decades has seen an overwhelming increase in the amount of digitised and born digital information. There has also been a growing need for specialised systems tailored to better handle this digital content. \glspl{dl} are specifically designed to store, manage and preserve digital objects over long periods of time. Figure~\ref{fig:introduction:overview:digital-library-system-architecture} illustrates a high-level view of a typical \gls{dls} architecture.
